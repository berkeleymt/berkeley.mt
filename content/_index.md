# Promoting advanced math to middle and high school students

The Berkeley Math Tournament is a UC Berkeley student-led organization that aims
to spread mathematics and the spirit of mathematical competition globally by
presenting students with interesting, original, hand-crafted problems. As of
2023, we are one of the largest student-run math competitions on the West Coast
with over 2000 contestants.
