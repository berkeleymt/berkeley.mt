The Berkeley Math Tournament Group hosts and organizes mathematical contests for
middle and high school students. In organizing these tournaments, the team
strives to encourage mathematical exploration and understanding by introducing
concepts not covered in the typical pre-college curricula to students with high
mathematical aptitude and interest. Each contest emphasizes collaboration
between team members, while still allowing individuals to prove their own
ability. Any individual currently enrolled in a pre-college institute for youth
is welcome to compete, and accommodations may be made for teams with
demonstrated financial need.

The contests that the Berkeley Math Tournament Group offers are:

- **BmMT: Berkeley mini Math Tournament.** Offered in the fall, this "mini"
  tournament aims to instill an appreciation for mathematics in teams of
  advanced elementary or middle school students and to prepare them for future
  mathematical endeavors.

- **BMT: Berkeley Math Tournament.** The spring tournament offers teams of high
  school students the opportunity to share their interest in mathematics with
  likeminded individuals and to get a taste of the type of concepts studied in
  higher mathematics.

Our team strives beyond an isolated environment of educational idealism, and is
a close-knit community where real impact is promoted by every one of our
members. Our values — integrity, teamwork, inclusion, and excellence — structure
all the work that we do.
