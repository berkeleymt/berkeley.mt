Welcome to Berkeley mini Math Tournament 2023! BmMT 2023 will be **in-person**,
with various **satellite tournaments**. The tournament will consist of 4 main
rounds — Puzzle, Individual, Team, and Relay.

BmMT is open to middle school students in **grades 8 or below**. In particular,
there is **no lower age limit** to compete in BmMT; advanced elementary students
are welcome to compete. Coaches can register **up to 5 students per team**.
There are no restrictions on how many teams/students a single coach can
register. You do not have to be local to the Bay Area or California to register
for BmMT.

# Registration Information

## Registration, Waivers, and Pricing

| Dates       | Registration Period | Price Per Student                              |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 2/28 – 3/20 | Normal Registration | $20                                            |
| 3/21 – 4/12 | Late Registration   | $30 and there is no guarantee of contest swag. |

**For students facing financial hardship, please contact
finance@bmt.berkeley.edu for a fee waiver.** As long as students register during
normal registration, they will receive BmMT shirts and swag as well as T-shirts
and other company giveaways from our sponsors. We will not honor refunds during
late registration.

We are now using a new registration portal. Coaches may register up to 5 people
per team, and ContestDojo will allow them to assign and modify teams up until
tournament day. **All contestants are required to have their parent/guardian
sign UC Berkeley’s consent waivers through this portal. Contestants will NOT be
allowed to take the contest without having a signed liability and consent to
treatment waiver.** Any questions about managing the teams on the portal should
be directed to us at questions@bmt.berkeley.edu.

## Student Eligibility

- Students must be in **grade 8 or below** to be eligible for BmMT.
- Students do not have to be local to the California Bay Area or the U.S. to
  participate in BmMT. Please see “Satellites” for other options on tournaments.
- Coaches may register multiple teams. We ask that **for every 2 teams, there is
  at least 1 parent chaperone**.
- **Due to room constraints, we will cut-off registration at 600 students on a
  first-come, first-serve basis.**

## Team Finder

Students may register as a team of 1, however, it is beneficial to compete on a
team of at least 3 due to our scoring guidelines. For students who do not have a
full team, we organized a ["Team Finder" document](team-finder). Follow all
outlined steps in the document.

# BmMT Rounds

### Puzzle Round (75 mins)

The puzzle round is a team-based round that consists of a variety of
mathematical challenges designed to promote inductive reasoning and lateral
thinking.

### Individual Round (60 mins)

The individual round consists of 20 short answer questions spanning various
subjects typically found in math competitions. This includes, but is not limited
to, algebra, geometry, counting, probability, and number theory.

### Team Round (60 mins)

The team round consists of 20 short answer questions. Students may work with
their teams on these questions.

### Relay Round (40 mins)

The relay round consists of 20 problems across various subjects in math. The key
feature of this round is that some questions may depend on answers from one or
multiple prior questions.

## Tiebreakers

The tiebreakers will be held for the top scoring students in the individual
round. Tiebreaker qualifiers will be announced at the end of the Relay Round,
and will be a 15-minute test. The test will consist of three questions, and be
scored primarily on correctness and secondarily on submission time; that is, an
earlier submission will be worth more than a later one with the same number of
correct answers, but less than a later one with more correct answers.

## Acceptable Answers

Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the
[acceptable test formatting document](/assets/answer-formats.pdf) and
[common notation document](/assets/answer-formats.pdf) for details on how their
answers should be submitted. Answers not submitted in the listed formats will be
graded as incorrect, even if equivalent.

## Scoring

To calculate the individual score, we will take the average of every team
member’s score on their individual portion if the team has 4, 5, or 6 members.
If the team has fewer than that many members, we will add 0’s until the team has
reached at least 4 scores, of which we will take the average.

While individuals are allowed to register a 1-person team, we highly encourage
students without a team to use the [Team-Finder](team-finder) to create a team
of at least 4.

Scores for a given round will be normalized by either the top 10 scores or the
top 10% score, whichever is greater.

If a student takes the General Round instead of the two Focus rounds, their
score will only count for half as many points as the Focus combination will.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Are calculators or other reference material allowed?

Graph paper and calculators are prohibited, but protractors, rulers, and
compasses are permitted. Blank white scratch paper will be provided for all
participants. All answers must be exact, reduced, and simplified. Illegible
answers will not be graded. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated, and
failure to comply with all rules may result in immediate and irreversible
disqualification.

### Can middle school students compete? What if I don’t have a team?

Yes! BmMT is open to any student in 8th grade or below, including those who
haven’t entered high school. While students are allowed to compete as
individuals under “LAST_NAME Homeschool” or some other variation, we highly
recommend that students compete on a team of at least 3 due to our scoring
guidelines. To calculate the overall Individual score, we will take the average
of every team member’s score on their individual portion if the team has 3, 4,
or 5 members. If the team has less than that many members, we will add 0’s until
the team has reached at least 3 scores, of which we will take the average.

### How are awards handled?

Awards will be physically presented to contestants at BmMT 2023’s closing
ceremony.

### I’m in a different timezone or non-local and can’t compete live. What are my options?

There will be BMT Satellite competitions held through our partners across the
globe for competitors wishing to compete in a different time zone.

### Will lunch be provided?

Lunch is **not provided** for BmMT 2023. Students, coaches and parents are free
to find food in Berkeley. Restaurants can be found on the south side of campus
(~5 minute walk from homerooms) and downtown (~15 minute walk from home rooms)

### Where can I find parking / How can I get around Berkeley?

BmMT will not be providing parking or travel arrangements for students — it is
up to coaches and/or parents to handle travel logistics. There are a number of
parking garages around the campus, including Underhill Structure, Lower Hearst
Structure, and the RSF garage. In addition, UC Berkeley campus is very public
transport friendly. If you are staying in Emeryville, Bus Line 36 will take you
directly to campus, and the Downtown Berkeley BART station is next to campus
