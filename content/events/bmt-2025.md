We're excited to welcome students back to the UC Berkeley campus on November 8,
2025, for this year's Berkeley Math Tournament! As in past years, the contest
will consist of three rounds: Power, Individual, and Guts.

<!-- more -->

BMT is open to high school students in **grades 12 or below**. In particular,
there is **no lower age limit** to participate; advanced middle school students
are welcome to compete. Teams may have up to 6 students. You do not have to be
local to the Bay Area or California to register for BMT.

For those unable to make it to UC Berkeley campus, we're also offering BMT
2025 Online, a synchronous online event, on **December 6, 2025**. Details about
the online tournament be found on the
[BMT 2025 Online Event Page](/events/bmt-2025-online/).

This page contains primarily registration details. Detailed information on
the schedule, rooms, and other day-of-tournament details will be released closer
to the event date.

## Student Eligibility

- Students must be in **grade 12 or below** to be eligible for BMT.
- Students do not have to be local to the Bay Area, California, or the U.S. to
  participate in BMT. However, we will offer BMT Online in either December or
  January (TBA), which may be more convenient for some students.
- Coaches may register multiple teams under the same organization. We ask that
  organizations provide at least one adult chaperone for every two teams.

## How to Register

Most pre- and post-contest tasks, including registration, team assignments,
signing of waivers, and viewing score reports, may be completed at
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/), an online math competition platform. If
you are unfamiliar with ContestDojo, please read our [ContestDojo Guide].

**All contestants under 18 are required to have their parent/guardian sign UC
Berkeley's consent waivers through this portal. Contestants will NOT be allowed
to take the contest without having a signed liability and consent to treatment
waiver. Students 18 and over may self-sign these waivers.**

Any questions about the ContestDojo portal should be directed to us at
<team@berkeley.mt>.

### Teammate Finder

Students may register as a team of 1. However, it is beneficial to compete on a
team of at least 4 due to our scoring guidelines. For students who do not have a
full team, we have organized a [Teammate Finder] spreadsheet. Follow all
outlined steps in the spreadsheet.

## Travel and Transportation

UC Berkeley is situated in the East Bay region of Northern California,
just across the bay from San Francisco. The Berkeley campus is a 10 to 15 minute
walk from the Downtown Berkeley BART transit station, which connects directly to
both the Oakland and San Francisco airports. Berkeley is also easily
accessible by car. Information about parking can be found in our
[FAQ](#where-can-i-find-parking-how-can-i-get-to-berkeley).

A printable PDF map of campus can be found
[here](https://www.berkeley.edu/map-pdf/campusmap.pdf), and more maps can be
found at [berkeley.edu/map](https://www.berkeley.edu/map). Note that the top of
the PDF map represents the eastern parts of campus. Google Maps is also usually
reliable for navigating campus.

### Hotels

For teams who are interested in booking a hotel room, we have a hotel room
block with discounted rates at the Hotel Shattuck Plaza around contest weekend.
**The cutoff date for booking is October 31, 2025.**

## Schedule

The event is expected to begin around 8:00 AM and end before 7:00 PM.

For detailed event schedule please see our [Tournament Day Logistics](/news/bmt-2025-logistics/) post.

### Lunch

This year, we are offering lunch for students, coaches, and parents at $12 per
person, catered from [Crave Subs](https://www.cravesubs.com/), a sandwich store
local to Berkeley. Those who wish to take this option **must pre-order on
ContestDojo** through their coach. There are three menu items to choose from:

- Ned Flanders — Turkey, Crave Sauce, Lettuce, & Tomato
- Mr. Incredible — Pastrami, Crave Sauce, Lettuce, & Tomato
- Vegan Marvin The Martian — Cucumbers, Pesto, Arugula, Crave Sauce, Lettuce, & Tomato

Students, coaches and parents are also free to find their own food. Many
restaurants can be found on the south side of campus (~5 minute walk from rooms)
and in Downtown Berkeley (~15 minute walk from rooms).

## Contest Format

### Power Round (90 mins)

The Power Round is a **proof-based team round.** Contestants will answer a
series of questions centered around a single topic not typically seen in
competitive mathematics, culminating in incredible results in the field of that
chosen topic. For all questions (unless stated otherwise), teams will need to
provide a rigorous mathematical justification for their assertions in full
sentences.

The topic for the Power Round will likely be at an undergraduate level, but no
substantial previous mathematical background is expected.

### Individual Round

For the Individual Round, students may choose to take either the General Test or
two Focus Tests.

#### General Test (90 mins)

The General Test is an individual test consisting of questions across the
various subjects that comprise the Focus Tests. This test is intended to be
easier than the Focus Tests and is highly recommended for students with less
prior contest experience.

#### Focus Tests (60 mins)

There are four Focus Tests of 10 questions across four subjects — Algebra,
Geometry, Discrete (Combinatorics and Number Theory), and Calculus. Each student
can participate in two Focus Tests.

### Guts Round (75 mins)

The Guts Round consists of **9 sets of 3 problems** across various subjects in
math. The key feature of this round is that each set must be turned in before
the next set is given. All teams can see a live scoreboard with their standings.

## Scoring

Individuals are only ranked within the tests they choose to take. Individual
Round scores are determined by the number of correct answers. Each correct
answer is worth 1 point, i.e. there is no weighting among the problems.

Team scores are determined based on a combination of teams' scores on the Guts
and Power Rounds, as well as the Individual Round scores of their team members.
The weights are displayed in the table in summary table below.

When weighting team scores, scores for a given test will be normalized by either
the average of the top 10 scores or the top 10% of scores, whichever represents
more students/teams. Additionally, if a student takes the General Test instead
of the two Focus Tests, their score will only count for half as many points as
the Focus Test combinations would.

### Tiebreakers

A tiebreaking procedure is employed for top awards for each test. Ties are not
broken for honorable mentions or calculating overall team scores.

To streamline the event, we have a new automatic tiebreaker policy this year,
which works as follows:

1. First, problems are ordered from **hardest** to **easiest**, based on the
   number of correct submissions.
1. The _n_-th hardest problem is assigned a **tiebreaking value** of
   2<sup>−*n*</sup>. For example, the hardest problem will have a tiebreaking
   value of ½, the second hardest problem will have a tiebreaking value of ¼, et
   cetera.
1. Each student's **tiebreaking index** is calculated as the sum of their
   original score and the tiebreaker values of the problems that they correctly
   answered.
1. Students are ordered by their tiebreaking index, determining their tiebroken
   rank.

In simpler terms, among those tied for the same score, whoever solved the
hardest problem is placed the highest, followed by the one who solved the next
hardest, and so on.

### Additional Tiebreaker Procedure

If a tie remains on the Individual Round after the preceding automatic
tiebreaking procedure -- i.e., if two students correctly answered precisely the
same set of problems, then those students will participate in an additional
Tiebreaker Round. Ties that remain on the Guts Round or Power Round will be
tiebroken.

This 15-minute test will consist of either three (for the Focus Tests) or five
(for the General Test) questions, and be scored primarily on correctness and
secondarily on submission time; i.e. an earlier submission will be worth more
than a later one with the same number of correct answers, but less than a later
one with more correct answers.

Students may submit multiple times within the duration of the test, but only the
last submission will be considered.

### Acceptable Answers

Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the [acceptable
answer formats document](/assets/answer-formats.pdf) and [common notions
document](/assets/common-notions.pdf) for details on how their answers should be
submitted. Answers not submitted in the listed formats will be graded as
incorrect, even if equivalent.

## Activities

After the Guts Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math.

For a full list of activities and their locations, please see the
[Tournament Day Logistics](/news/2025-11-03_bmt-2025-logistics/) post.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are calculators or other reference material allowed?

Graph paper and calculators are prohibited, but protractors, rulers, and
compasses are permitted. Blank white scratch paper will be provided for all
participants. All answers must be exact, reduced, and simplified. Illegible
answers will not be graded. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated, and
failure to comply with all rules may result in immediate and irreversible
disqualification.

### Can middle school students compete? What if I don't have a team?

Yes! BMT is open to any student in 12th grade or below, including those who
haven't entered high school. While students are allowed to compete as
individuals, we highly recommend that students compete on a team of at least 4
due to our scoring guidelines.

### How are awards handled?

Awards will be physically presented to contestants at the closing ceremony.

### I'm in a different timezone or non-local and can't compete live. What are my options?

There will be BMT Satellite competitions held through our partners across the
globe for competitors wishing to compete in a different time zone. Additionally,
we may offer an online option for remote participation.

### Where can I find parking? How can I get to Berkeley?

BMT does not provide travel or parking for students — coaches should arrange
their own travel logistics. There are a number of parking garages around campus,
including the Telegraph-Channing Garage, Underhill Structure, Lower Hearst
Structure, and the RSF Garage.

The Telegraph-Channing Garage is recommended for most people; it is cheaper than
campus-owned garages (and free up to an hour) and more conveniently located than
most of the garages listed.

Berkeley is also public-transport-friendly. The Downtown Berkeley BART station
is next to campus, and may be a good fit for those commuting from San Francisco
or the East Bay. For teams staying in Emeryville, bus line 36 will take you
directly to campus. Check the [AC Transit](https://www.actransit.org/) website
for more options.
