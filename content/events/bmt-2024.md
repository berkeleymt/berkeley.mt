## Registration Timeline

Registration will open on **Monday, September 16 at 9:00 AM PT**. This year,
registration will take place in two phases to give smaller organizations an
opportunity to register.

{% alert(title="Limited Capacity Available", status="info") %}
Due to capacity constraints, we will be limiting registration to 1,000
participants. While we don't expect to reach this limit in Phase 1, we encourage
coaches to register as soon as possible to guarantee space.

## Student Eligibility

- Students must be in **grade 12 or below** to be eligible for BMT.
- Students do not have to be local to the California Bay Area or the U.S. to
  participate in BMT. However, we will offer BMT Online in either December or
  January (TBA), which may be a better fit for some students.
- Coaches may register multiple teams. We ask that **for every 2 teams, there is
  at least 1 parent chaperone**.

## How to Register

Most pre- and post-contest operations, including registration, team formation,
waivers, and score reports, should be performed on
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/), an online math competition platform.
For people unfamiliar with ContestDojo, we have a released a guide, which can be
found here: [ContestDojo Guide].

**All contestants are required to have their parent/guardian sign UC Berkeley’s
consent waivers through this portal. Contestants will NOT be allowed to take the
contest without having a signed liability and consent to treatment waiver.**

Any questions about the ContestDojo portal should be directed to us at
<team@berkeley.mt>.

### Team Finder

Students may register as a team of 1, however, it is beneficial to compete on a
team of at least 4 due to our scoring guidelines. For students who do not have a
full team, we organized a [Team-Finder] document. Follow all outlined steps in
the document.

## Schedule

Our event schedule is yet to be finalized, but we expect the tournament to start
at 7:30 AM and end before 7:30 PM, with a lunch break in the middle.

## Contest Format

### Power Round (90 mins)

The Power Round is a **proof-based team round.** Contestants will answer a
series of questions centered around a single topic not typically seen in
competitive mathematics, culminating in incredible results in the field of that
chosen topic. For all questions (unless stated otherwise), teams will need to
provide a rigorous mathematical justification for their assertions in full
sentences.

The topic for the Power Round will likely be at an undergraduate level, but no
substantial previous mathematical background is expected.

### Individual Round

For the Individual Round, students may choose to take either the General Test
or two Focus Tests.

#### General Test (90 mins)

The General Test is an individual round consisting of questions across the
various subjects that comprise the focus tests. This round is highly recommended
for students with less prior contest experience.

#### Focus Tests (60 mins)

There are four focus tests of 10 questions across four subjects — Algebra,
Geometry, Discrete Math, and Calculus. Each student can participate in two focus
exams.

### Guts Round (75 mins)

The guts round consists of **9 sets of 3 problems** across various subjects in
math. The key feature of this round is that each set must be turned in before
the next set is given. All teams can see a live scoreboard with their standings.

## Scoring

Individuals are only ranked within the tests they choose to take. Individual
Round scores are determined by the number of correct answers. Each correct
answer is worth 1 point, i.e. there is no weighting among the problems.

Team scores are determined based on a combination of teams' scores on the Guts
and Power Rounds, as well as the Individual Round scores of their team members.
The weights are displayed in the table in summary table below.

When weighting team scores, scores for a given test will be normalized by
either the top 10 scores or the top 10% score, whichever is greater.
Additionally, if a student takes the General Test instead of the two Focus
Tests, their score will only count for half as many points as the Focus
combination would.

### Tiebreakers

To streamline the event, we have a new automatic tiebreaker policy this year,
which works as follows:

1. First, problems are ordered from **hardest** to **easiest**, based on the
   number of correct submissions.
1. The _n_-th hardest problem is assigned a **tiebreaking value** of
   2<sup>−*n*</sup>. For example, the hardest problem will have a tiebreaking
   value of ½, the second hardest problem will have a tiebreaking value of ¼,
   et cetera.
1. Each student's **adjusted score** is calculated as the sum of
   their original score and the tiebreaker values of the problems that they
   correctly answered.
1. Students are ordered by their adjusted scores, determining their **rank**.

In simpler terms, among those tied for the same score, whoever solved the
hardest problem is placed the highest, followed by the one who solved the next
hardest, and so on. Note that tiebreakers only break ties for individual awards,
not for honorable mentions or for calculating team scores.

### Additional Tiebreaker Procedure

The automatic tiebreaking procedure may still fail to break ties — i.e., if two
students correctly answered precisely the same set of problems. In this case,
those students will be called in for an additional tiebreaker.

This 15-minute test will consist of three questions, and be scored primarily on
correctness and secondarily on submission time; that is, an earlier submission
will be worth more than a later one with the same number of correct answers, but
less than a later one with more correct answers.

Students may submit multiple times within the duration of the test, but only the
last submission will be considered.

### Acceptable Answers

Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the
[acceptable test formatting document](/assets/answer-formats.pdf) and
[common notions document](/assets/common-notions.pdf) for details on how their
answers should be submitted. Answers not submitted in the listed formats will be
graded as incorrect, even if equivalent.

## Activities

After lunch, we will be hosting optional student activities that promote
recreational math. Students that choose to participate will have the opportunity
to win amazing prizes! Below are the activities we are expecting to run:

### Estimathon

A team-based contest that combines trivia, game theory, strategy, and
mathematical thinking. Teams of ~3 will face a tight time limit to work on a set
of 13 Fermi-style estimation problems.

### Fraudulent Math

Attention all students! Mathematics is under attack by people who claim that we
need “rigor” and “logic” to justify our answers. Join us for an event of
Fraudulent Math, where students will compete to come up with the most
outlandish, mind bending proofs of false statements and to create impossible
constructions.

### Integration Bee

The hypest activity at BMT: compete head to head against the best integrators
around! Students will face off in a tournament style bracket, solving difficult
integrals involving some clever tricks, to determine who will be the champion of
all integrators.

### Origami

Do you want to bring home a cute souvenir from BMT? Come join us for a fun
origami session! We will be offering multiple paper patterns and instructions,
and teaching from the basics of origami. No prior craft experience is needed!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are calculators or other reference material allowed?

Graph paper and calculators are prohibited, but protractors, rulers, and
compasses are permitted. Blank white scratch paper will be provided for all
participants. All answers must be exact, reduced, and simplified. Illegible
answers will not be graded. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated, and
failure to comply with all rules may result in immediate and irreversible
disqualification.

### Can middle school students compete? What if I don’t have a team?

Yes! BMT is open to any student in 12th grade or below, including those who
haven’t entered high school. While students are allowed to compete as
individuals, we highly recommend that students compete on a team of at least 4
due to our scoring guidelines.

To calculate the overall Individual score, we will take the average of every
team member’s score on their individual portion if the team has 4, 5, or 6
members. If the team has less than that many members, we will add 0’s until the
team has reached at least 4 scores, of which we will take the average.

### How are awards handled?

Awards will be physically presented to contestants at the closing ceremony.

### I’m in a different timezone or non-local and can’t compete live. What are my options?

There will be BMT Satellite competitions held through our partners across the
globe for competitors wishing to compete in a different time zone.

### Will lunch be provided?

Lunch is **not provided**. Students, coaches and parents are free to find food
in Berkeley. Restaurants can be found on the south side of campus (~5 minute
walk from rooms) and downtown (~15 minute walk from rooms).

### Where can I find parking / How can I get around Berkeley?

BMT will not be providing parking or travel arrangements for students — it is up
to coaches and/or parents to handle travel logistics. There are a number of
parking garages around the campus, including Underhill Structure, Lower Hearst
Structure, and the RSF garage. In addition, UC Berkeley campus is very public
transport friendly.

If you are staying in Emeryville, Bus Line 36 will take you directly to campus,
and the Downtown Berkeley BART station is next to campus.
