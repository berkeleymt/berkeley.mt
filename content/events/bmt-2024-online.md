The online, synchronous version of our flagship high school tournament! For
those who are unable to travel long-distance to California, or weren't able to
register for BMT 2024 due to capacity limitations, we're offering an online
experience as well.

<!-- more -->

The online tournament will consist of an asynchronous Power Round on **November
30–December 1, 2024**, as well as the live event, including the Guts and
Focus/General rounds on **December 7, 2024**.

BMT is intended for high school students, but is open to all students **12th grade
and below**, including advanced students at younger grade levels. You may register
**up to 6 students per team**. There are no restrictions on how many teams/students
can participate.

## Registration, Waivers, and Pricing

You may register for BMT 2024 Online on ContestDojo any time until November 28,
2024 at 11:59 PM US Pacific Time.

Registration is performed on ContestDojo. Coaches may register up to 6 people
per team, and ContestDojo will allow them to assign and modify teams up until
tournament day. In addition, for BMT Online, students may also register and form
teams with other students without a coach.

The fee for the online tournament is **$8 per student**.

**All contestants are required to have their parent/guardian sign UC Berkeley’s
consent waivers through this portal. Contestants will NOT be allowed to take the
contest without having a signed liability waiver.**

Any questions about the ContestDojo portal should be directed to us at
<team@berkeley.mt>.

\*For students facing financial hardship, please contact
<finance@berkeley.mt> for a fee waiver. We will not honor refunds during
late registration.

## Student Eligibility

- Students must be in **grade 12 or below** to be eligible for BMT.
- Students do not have to be from the same school.
- Students **must not have competed in a prior iteration of BMT 2024**,
  including the California version or any of our satellites.
- Coaches may register as few or as many teams as they wish.

## Teammate Finder

Students may register as a team of 1. However, it is beneficial to compete on a
team of at least 4 due to our scoring guidelines. For students who do not have a
full team, we have organized a [Teammate Finder] spreadsheet. Follow all
outlined steps in the spreadsheet.

## Contest Format

### Power Round (90 mins)

The Power Round is a **proof-based team round.** Contestants will answer a
series of questions centered around a single topic not typically seen in
competitive mathematics, culminating in incredible results in the field of that
chosen topic. For all questions (unless stated otherwise), teams will need to
provide a rigorous mathematical justification for their assertions in full
sentences.

The topic for the Power Round will likely be at an undergraduate level, but no
substantial previous mathematical background is expected.

### Individual Round

For the Individual Round, students may choose to take either the General Test or
two Focus Tests.

#### General Test (90 mins)

The General Test is an individual test consisting of questions across the
various subjects that comprise the Focus Tests. This test is intended to be
easier than the Focus Tests and is highly recommended for students with less
prior contest experience.

#### Focus Tests (60 mins)

There are four Focus Tests of 10 questions across four subjects — Algebra,
Geometry, Discrete (Combinatorics and Number Theory), and Calculus. Each student
can participate in two Focus Tests.

### Guts Round (75 mins)

The Guts Round consists of **9 sets of 3 problems** across various subjects in
math. The key feature of this round is that each set must be turned in before
the next set is given. All teams can see a live scoreboard with their standings.

## Scoring

Individuals are only ranked within the tests they choose to take. Individual
Round scores are determined by the number of correct answers. Each correct
answer is worth 1 point, i.e. there is no weighting among the problems.

Team scores are determined based on a combination of teams' scores on the Guts
and Power Rounds, as well as the Individual Round scores of their team members.
The weights are displayed in the table in summary table below.

When weighting team scores, scores for a given test will be normalized by either
the average of the top 10 scores or the top 10% of scores, whichever represents
more students/teams. Additionally, if a student takes the General Test instead
of the two Focus Tests, their score will only count for half as many points as
the Focus Test combinations would.

The asynchronous Power Round will not be counted towards the overall team score;
we will have a separate ranking category for the Power Round.

### Tiebreakers

A tiebreaking procedure is employed for top awards for each test. Ties are not
broken for honorable mentions or calculating overall team scores.

To streamline the event, we have a new automatic tiebreaker policy this year,
which works as follows:

1. First, problems are ordered from **hardest** to **easiest**, based on the
   number of correct submissions.
1. The _n_-th hardest problem is assigned a **tiebreaking value** of
   2<sup>−*n*</sup>. For example, the hardest problem will have a tiebreaking
   value of ½, the second hardest problem will have a tiebreaking value of ¼, et
   cetera.
1. Each student's **tiebreaking index** is calculated as the sum of their
   original score and the tiebreaker values of the problems that they correctly
   answered.
1. Students are ordered by their tiebreaking index, determining their tiebroken
   rank.

In simpler terms, among those tied for the same score, whoever solved the
hardest problem is placed the highest, followed by the one who solved the next
hardest, and so on.

### Additional Tiebreaker Procedure

If a tie remains on the Individual Round after the preceding automatic
tiebreaking procedure -- i.e., if two students correctly answered precisely the
same set of problems, then those students will participate in an additional
Tiebreaker Round. Ties that remain on the Guts Round or Power Round will be
tiebroken.

This 15-minute test will consist of either three (for the Focus Tests) or five
(for the General Test) questions, and be scored primarily on correctness and
secondarily on submission time; i.e. an earlier submission will be worth more
than a later one with the same number of correct answers, but less than a later
one with more correct answers.

Students may submit multiple times within the duration of the test, but only the
last submission will be considered.

### Acceptable Answers

Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the [acceptable
answer formats document](/assets/answer-formats.pdf) and [common notions
document](/assets/common-notions.pdf) for details on how their answers should be
submitted. Answers not submitted in the listed formats will be graded as
incorrect, even if equivalent.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are calculators or other reference material allowed?

Graph paper and calculators are prohibited, but protractors, rulers, and
compasses are permitted. Blank white scratch paper will be provided for all
participants. All answers must be exact, reduced, and simplified. Illegible
answers will not be graded. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated, and
failure to comply with all rules may result in immediate and irreversible
disqualification.

### Can middle school students compete? What if I don't have a team?

Yes! BMT is open to any student in 12th grade or below, including those who
haven't entered high school. While students are allowed to compete as
individuals, we highly recommend that students compete on a team of at least 4
due to our scoring guidelines.

### Will there be awards?

Although we will provide an official ranking as well as certificates for
top-scoring teams, there will not be physical awards for the online tournament.
