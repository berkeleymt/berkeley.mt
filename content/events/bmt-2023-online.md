# BMT Rounds

### Power Round (90 mins)

The Power Round is a **proof-based team round.** Contestants will answer a
series of questions centered around a single topic not typically seen in
competitive mathematics, culminating in incredible results in the field of that
chosen topic. For all questions (unless stated otherwise), you will need to
provide a rigorous mathematical justification for your assertions in full
sentences. The topic for the Power Round will likely be at an undergraduate
level, but no substantial previous mathematical background is expected.

### General Round (90 mins)

The general round is an **individual round** consisting of questions across the
various subjects that comprise the focus rounds. This round is **highly
recommended** for students with less prior contest experience.\*

### Focus Rounds (60 mins)

There are four focus rounds of 10 questions across four subjects --- Algebra,
Geometry, Discrete Math, and Calculus. Each student can participate in **two
rounds** of focus exams.\*

### Guts Round (75 mins)

The guts round consists of **9 sets of 3 problems** across various subjects in
math. The key feature of this round is that each set **must be turned in**
before the next set is given. All teams can see a live scoreboard with their
standings

\*Students may choose to **either** take the General Round **or** two Focus
Rounds.

## Tiebreakers

The tiebreakers will be held for the top scoring students in the individual
round. Tiebreaker qualifiers will be announced at the end of lunch and the
beginning of activities, and will be a 15-minute test. The test will consist of
three questions, and be scored primarily on correctness and secondarily on
submission time; that is, an earlier submission will be worth more than a later
one with the same number of correct answers, but less than a later one with more
correct answers.

## Acceptable Answers

Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the
[acceptable test formatting document](/assets/answer-formats.pdf) and
[common notions document](/assets/common-notions.pdf) for details on how their
answers should be submitted. Answers not submitted in the listed formats will be
graded as incorrect, even if equivalent.

## Scoring

To calculate the individual score, we will take the average of every team
member’s score on their individual portion if the team has 4, 5, or 6 members.
If the team has fewer than that many members, we will add 0’s until the team has
reached at least 4 scores, of which we will take the average.

While individuals are allowed to register a 1-person team, we highly encourage
students without a team to use the [Team-Finder] to create a team of at least 4.

Scores for a given round will be normalized by either the top 10 scores or the
top 10% score, whichever is greater.

If a student takes the General Round instead of the two Focus rounds, their
score will only count for half as many points as the Focus combination will.

The asynchronous Power Round will not be counted towards the overall team score;
we will have a separate ranking category for the Power Round.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Are calculators or other reference material allowed?

Graph paper and calculators are prohibited, but protractors, rulers, and
compasses are permitted. Blank white scratch paper will be provided for all
participants. All answers must be exact, reduced, and simplified. Illegible
answers will not be graded. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated, and
failure to comply with all rules may result in immediate and irreversible
disqualification.

### Can middle school students compete? What if I don’t have a team?

Yes! BMT is open to any student in 8th grade or below, including those who
haven’t entered high school. While students are allowed to compete as
individuals under “LAST_NAME Homeschool” or some other variation, we highly
recommend that students compete on a team of at least 4 due to our scoring
guidelines. To calculate the overall Individual score, we will take the average
of every team member’s score on their individual portion if the team has 4, 5,
or 6 members. If the team has less than that many members, we will add 0’s until
the team has reached at least 4 scores, of which we will take the average.

### Will there be awards?

Although we will provide an official ranking as well as certificates for
top-scoring teams, there will not be physical awards for the online tournament.
