Hi Everyone,

We are very excited to announce that for the first time since the COVID-19
pandemic hit, we will be holding an **in-person tournament** for this year's
Berkeley Math Tournament! It will be held on **Saturday, November 5, 2022**, on
the UC Berkeley campus, so make sure you save the date!

This in-person format will allow for us to provide a different, though just as
engaging, experience than our recent fully virtual tournaments, so we are
enthusiastic to deliver an unforgettable event for you. However, we do
understand that this may make it more difficult to attend. If you are unable to
make the in-person BMT 2022, do stay tuned for information regarding our
informal, asynchronous online BMT.

For those curious about the problem style, past contests can be found in our
archive at [this link](https://bmt.berkeley.edu/archive).

Registration will be opening up very soon, so do check your email for
instructions on how to register. Additional details about the competition and
its logistics will also be included in a future email.

If you have any questions, feel free to email at <questions@bmt.berkeley.edu>.

Hope to see you there!

BMT
