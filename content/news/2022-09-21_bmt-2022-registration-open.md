Hello everyone,

We are excited to let you know that registration for the 2022 Berkeley Math
Tournament has now opened! You can register through
[our website](/events/bmmt-2023), which is where you can also find further
information on the contest itself.

We will be holding an **in-person tournament** for BMT 2022 on Saturday,
November 5, on UC Berkeley campus. This format will likely make it more
difficult to attend in comparison to the past online BMTs, so if you are unable
to make the in-person BMT 2022, we do provide other versions of the competition,
such as an our informal, asynchronous online BMT, in addition to a few satellite
BMTs across the world. Stay tuned for further information on all of that!

Coaches can register up to 6 people per team, and as many teams as they would
like. However, please note that we ask for at least 1 adult chaperone for every
2 teams you plan on bringing. Additionally, upon registration, parental consent
forms will be made available on Contest Dojo - students will not be allowed to
participate in the tournament without these waivers being signed.

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at <questions@bmt.berkeley.edu>

**We hope to see you there!**

Best regards, BMT
