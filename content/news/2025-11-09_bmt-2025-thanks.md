To all coaches, students, and parents,

Thank you for coming to BMT 2025! With nearly 1,400 students on campus, this was
our largest competition to date (for now!) so we hope this year's tournament was
as memorable for you as it was for us. We are immensely grateful for all the
excitement, enthusiasm, and competitive spirit every one of you brought to the
tournament. It was a truly rewarding experience seeing so many talented,
passionate students come together to explore mathematics.

Lastly, remember: BMT is not just a competition, but also a celebration of
talent, hard work, and camaraderie. We hope you found it to be an enriching
experience and took away not only lessons in math, but also unforgettable moments of
connection and fun — with all your friends and teammates.

We'll be sending out score reports soon. Let's build even more memories together
next year!

~ Your friends at BMT
