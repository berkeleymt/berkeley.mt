+++

Score reports for BmMT 2025 have been released on [ContestDojo]. We thank
everyone for their patience, and apologize for the extended delay. We know
students have been anxiously awaiting their scores for nearly two months. This
delay is not acceptable and we have streamlined the process for future events.

On ContestDojo, students can download their **individual score report**, which
details their own performance on the Individual Round, and their team's
performance on the Puzzle, Team, and Relay Rounds, with accompanying statistics.
The report also contains a scan of each answer sheet submitted.

In addition to the individual score reports for each member, coaches can also
download **team score reports**, which contain the Individual Round details and
scans for _all_ team members, as well as a detailed breakdown of the calculation
of the team's overall score.

Due to an error in our automatic tiebreaking procedure this past April, we’ve
decided to void the auto tiebreaking policy for all rounds. Students’ updated
rankings are now reflected in the score report, and we’ve contacted teams whose
revised placements make them eligible for awards.
