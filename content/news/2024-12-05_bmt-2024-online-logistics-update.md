## Discord Server

The entirety of the event, including the Opening and Awards ceremonies, as well
as the testing rounds, will take place on [Discord]. Discord is a communication
platform that allows for real-time chat, voice, and video calls. Students should
sign up for an account on the platform.

Students will receive a link to join the Discord server via email.

## ContestDojo Sample Rounds

Tests will be conducted through the [ContestDojo] platform, which is the same as
the website that you used to register. We have now opened a Sample Individual
Round and a Sample Team Round that you can use to familiarize yourself with the
system, especially collaborating with your team. We highly recommend all
participants test out their system before the contest — if you run into any
issues, please email us at <team@berkeley.mt>.

## Guts Round Scoreboard

As a reminder, the Guts Round is taken in 9 sets of 3 problems and graded live
on a public leaderboard. You will be able to see your team's progress as well as
the progress of other teams. The live scoreboard will be streamed over Zoom and
can additionally be accessed at this link on the day of the event:

## Activities

After the Guts Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Estimathon** — A contest combining trivia, strategic planning, and sharp
  mathematical thinking. Teams of ~6 will race against the clock to tackle a
  challenging set of 13 Fermi-style problems, testing their ability to think fast
  and outsmart the competition.

- **Fraudulent Math** — Attention all students! Mathematics is under attack by
  people who claim that we need _rigor_ and _logic_ to justify our answers.
  Compete to see who can come up with the most outlandish, mind-bending falsehoods
  and impossible constructions.

- **Puzzle Platter** — Dive into a delectable feast of mind-bending puzzles from
  BmMT's greatest hits! Challenge yourself with our curated collection of the most
  engaging and creative puzzle rounds from past tournaments.

## Waivers

Reminder that waivers MUST be completed prior to the tournament. No exceptions
can be made — the system will lock you out of starting a test until your waiver
is completed.

We're excited to see everyone online in a few days! As always, if you need a
question answered, or have a issue/concern leading up to the event, please email
us at <team@berkeley.mt. We'll be happy to take care of your issue ASAP.

Best regards, \
BMT Coordinators
