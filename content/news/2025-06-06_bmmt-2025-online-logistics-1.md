The Zoom link has been emailed to each coach and competitor. If you still have not received a Zoom link by 8AM PT, send an email to <team@berkeley.mt> (after checking your Spam and Junk folders).

Only participants are allowed in the Zoom room. Parents, guardians, and other spectators should not join the Zoom.

# Communication
As a reminder, you are responsible for setting up your own communication with your team — the BmMT team will not be coordinating communication, and the main Zoom room will not be able to be used to communicate with your teammates. 

# Waivers
If your waiver is not yet signed, please have it signed by the opening ceremony tomorrow. You will not be allowed to participate in any of the events without having your waiver signed, and no extra time will be given if you are unable to start due to not having a signed waiver.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What should coaches/parents do during the event?

Coaches/parents should help their students log into Zoom and their ContestDojo student accounts; no further action is required from coaches on the day of the event. As long as all of your students are successfully registered (placed on a team and their waivers are signed), then you are all set! Coaches are welcome to join the Opening and Award Ceremonies. Due to Zoom capacity restrictions, we ask that parents watch the Opening and Award Ceremonies with their children on the same device.

## Will students be penalized for not attending the Opening Ceremony?

We will go over the schedule and how to navigate the Puzzle website and ContestDojo during the opening ceremony, so we strongly encourage students to attend. While there is no score penalty for missing the opening ceremony, students who encounter difficulties navigating ContestDojo or the Puzzle website will not receive extra time. Please be sure to attend the opening ceremony to familiarize yourself with both platforms.

## Can students be in the same room while taking the individual test?

Yes. During the individual round, students may be in the same room, but they must work independently. Each student should submit answers on their own device and refrain from communicating. We will be monitoring submissions for suspicious patterns and activity. 

## Can students work together on the Team, Relay, and Puzzle rounds in person if they are on the same team? 

Yes! We encourage students in the same team to collaborate in person or online during the team rounds. 

## How do students submit the team round answers?

Students can choose to share a device or use their own devices to submit team round answers. ContestDojo will automatically sync everyone’s work so that when one teammate updates an answer, it automatically updates for the other team members, and only the most recently inputted answer is submitted.

Note that it may be helpful for team members to have their own device open (even just to view the questions), so everyone can follow along and discuss in real time.

## Are calculators or other reference material allowed?
Graph paper and calculators are prohibited, but protractors, rulers, scratch paper, and compasses are permitted. You may print out the questions if you would like. Use of AI or any other outside resource during the testing round is strictly prohibited. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated, and failure to comply with all rules may result in immediate and irreversible disqualification. Students who have viewed the exam or its solutions should come forward and not take the tests.
