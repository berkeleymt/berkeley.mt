The entirety of the event, including the Opening and Awards ceremonies, as well
as the testing rounds, will take place on [Zoom], video conferencing software.
Students should download the Zoom software to their computer prior to the event.
The Zoom meeting link will be sent to students the morning of the event.

All rounds will be taken on the [ContestDojo] platform. Students will use the
platform to view problems, submit answers, as well as collaborate with their
teams.

All students should ensure that they can login to ContestDojo prior to the
event. If students were registered by a coach, they have received an email
containing their sign-in details. If students are having trouble logging in or
locating the BmMT 2025 Online event, please try the Forgot Password function, or
email <team@berkeley.mt> for assistance.

A sample test has been opened on ContestDojo for students to familiarize
themselves with the platform. A brief guide on how to use the site will also be
shown during the opening ceremony, though we highly encourage students to try
the sample test beforehand to ensure a smooth process.

The Puzzle Round will involve the use of a separate website, in addition to
ContestDojo. Instructions on how to use the Puzzle Round website will be
provided on Zoom prior to the start of the test.

## Tiebreakers

Reminder that we have a new Automatic Tiebreaking Policy! If you are not called
for a tiebreaker round, this does _not_ mean you did not place in the top five.

If necessary, additional tiebreaker rounds will be held as needed for top
scorers in the Individual Round. Tiebreaker qualifiers will be announced at the
end of lunch, and will take a 15-minute test during the activities session. The
test will consist of three questions, and be scored primarily on correctness and
secondarily on submission time; that is, an earlier submission will be worth more
than a later one with the same number of correct answers, but less than a later
one with more correct answers.

### Activities

After the Relay Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Estimathon** — Got wit and strategy? Come to our Estimathon®, a contest
  combining trivia, strategic planning, and sharp mathematical thinking. Teams
  of up to 3 will race against the clock to tackle a challenging set of 13
  Fermi-style problems, testing their ability to think fast and outsmart the
  competition.

- **Turtle Art** — Unleash your creativity while learning to code! Explore the
  basics of Python programming using Turtle, a graphics library that turns code
  into cool drawings. No experience needed—just bring your curiosity!

- **Infini-bee** — Get to know infinity in our Infinity Bee, more affectionately
  known as the Infini-bee! What happens when you add infinite numbers? Draw
  unlimited shapes? Perform boundless jumps? Learn all of this and more at our
  Infini-bee!

## Awards

Top-scoring individuals and teams will be announced at the Awards Ceremony from
4:30 – 5:00 PM. For BmMT Online, we will provide an official ranking as well as
certificates for top-scoring teams. However, there will not be physical awards
for the online tournament.
