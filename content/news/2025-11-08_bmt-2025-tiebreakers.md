We are requesting the following students to participate in a tiebreaker round.

Reminder that we have an [Automatic Tiebreaking Policy](https://berkeley.mt/events/bmt-2025/#tiebreakers). Furthermore, if you were not called for the tiebreaker round, this does _not_ mean you did not place in the top five.
