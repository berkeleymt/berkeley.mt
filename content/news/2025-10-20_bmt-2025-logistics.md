## General Reminders

During BMT, we will be posting updates to the website (<https://berkeley.mt>),
including tiebreaker qualifiers. Please be on the lookout for any announcements.
For any day-of directions, questions or concerns ask a BMT staff member or
volunteer, which you can identify by their pale pink BMT shirt.

An annotated campus map is provided at the bottom of this page.

## Arrival and Check-in

{% alert(title="Online check-in available", status="info") %}
From November 5 to November 7, coaches can optionally begin the check-in process
online on [ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com). We recommend organizations
that are ready to check in to do so online before Saturday.

If you check-in online, you must still show up at your assigned check-in
location to pick up materials.
{% end %}

Check-in will happen from **7:40 AM to 8:45 AM** in the following rooms:

- **Dwinelle 145** — Coaches who haven't checked in online should go here.
- **Dwinelle 155** — Coaches who checked in online should go here for materials pick-up.

At check-in, coaches will receive:

- A sticker sheet containing name tags for each student with their ID, as well
  as their room assignments. **Students are responsible for remembering their
  student ID throughout the day. If a student writes an incorrect ID on their
  test, they may not receive a score.**

- An information packet about the tournament, containing a schedule, map, and
  other relevant information.

- A bag containing any pre-ordered t-shirts for the organization.

- A voucher for pre-ordered lunches, which can be redeemed during the lunch
  break in front of Dwinelle Hall.

**Check in closes promptly at 8:45 AM**, so please be on time. If you arrive
after this time, your team will be late to the power round, which puts them at a
great disadvantage.

### What to pack

We suggest students bring the following items to BMT:

- A backpack or small bag for carrying materials and swag
- Multiple pencils and erasers
- Lunch or money for lunch, if you didn't order it
- A water bottle to stay hydrated throughout the day
- Comfortable walking shoes (you'll be moving between buildings)
- Layers of clothing (temperatures can vary)

Scratch paper will be provided for all participants, so please do not bring your
own.

### Travel and Transportation

If convenient, we recommend taking BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to campus. The **Downtown Berkeley BART station** is located just a few blocks from campus and provides easy access to the tournament venues. From the station, it's approximately a 10-minute walk to Dwinelle Hall. Taking BART can help you avoid parking challenges and traffic, especially during peak hours.

If you would prefer to drive, parking can be found near campus at many
locations. We recommend the following options, which are also highlighted on the
map attached below:

- Telegraph-Channing Garage
- RSF Garage
- Underhill Parking
- Stadium Parking Garage
- Allston Way Garage
- Center Street Garage
- Lower Hearst Structure
- UNEX Lot

## Testing Rooms

Each team will be assigned a room for their Power Round, Guts Round, and Awards
Ceremony during check-in. Room assignments will be provided on the sticker sheet
as well as emailed to all coaches, along with Team and Student IDs.

For Focus and General tests, students may go to any of the rooms assigned to
the test combination they selected. **Room assignments for each test combination
are listed on the tournament guide.**

Students are responsible for finding the rooms that their tests are taking place
in. A map is attached in the information packet provided at check-in.

## Lunch

There will be a one-hour lunch period in the middle of the day for students to
get food. Pre-purchased lunches will be available for pick up outside Dwinelle
Hall. Many other options are available on the southern side of Berkeley campus.

Lunch is available for purchase until October 31, 2025.

## Activities

### Student Activities

After the Guts Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

#### ⭐ Bitcoin, Hacking, and Fermat's Last Theorem _by [Pico Gilman](https://picogilman.github.io/) [Dwinelle 145]_

What is the relationship between bitcoin, large number factorization, and
Fermat's Last Theorem? In this talk, third year undergraduate MIT student Pico
Gilman will explain how to efficiently count the number of points on elliptic
curves using C++! No knowledge of elliptic curves or coding is needed.

Pico Gilman is a 2025 Barry Goldwater scholar and 6th place for the Putnam
Mathematical Competition, studying number theory and elliptic curves at MIT.

#### ⭐ Hamster Rescue Team Puzzle Hunt _by [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/) [Pauley Ballroom]_

Ready to unleash your puzzle-solving skills and embark on a whisker-twitching
adventure? Join HRT's Hamster Rescue Team — a puzzle hunt where you and your
fellow Hamster Rescuers will work together to save adorable hamsters in need,
and earn cool prizes along the way! Can your team puzzle its way to
hamster-saving glory, or will you get stuck spinning your wheels? Come find
out at HRT — your furry friends are counting on you!

#### Origami _by [Cal Origami](https://calorigami.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) [VLSB 2040]_

Do you want to bring home a cute souvenir from BMT? Come make your own origami
dodecahedron! We will be offering multiple paper patterns and instructions,
and teaching from the basics of modular origami. No prior craft experience is
needed!

#### Float Your Boat: The Archimedes Challenge _by [Society of Physics Students](https://sps.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) [Wheeler 102, 108]_

In 250 BC, Archimedes discovered the principle of buoyancy, noticing it in his
bathtub and using it to prove the kings' crowns were made of gold. Can you use
it to keep heavy boats afloat?

#### Estimathon _[VLSB 2050, 2060]_

Got wit and strategy? Come to our Estimathon®, a contest combining trivia,
strategic planning, and sharp mathematical thinking. Teams of up to 3 will
race against the clock to tackle a challenging set of 13 Fermi-style problems,
testing their ability to think fast and outsmart the competition.

#### Integration Bee _[Dwinelle 155]_

Compete head to head against the best integrators around! Students will face
off in a tournament style bracket, solving difficult integrals involving some
clever tricks, to determine who will be the champion of all integrators.

#### Plank Countdown _[Wheeler 120, 124, 126, 130]_

Miss the excitement of the MATHCOUNTS® Countdown Round? Want to show off
mental math in a countdown match... while planking? If you'd enjoy that
exciting and silly experience, come join us for our Plank Countdown
tournament!

#### Fraudulent Math _[Wheeler 204, 202]_

Attention all students, mathematics is under attack by people who claim that
we need "rigor" and "logic" to justify our answers. Join us for an event of
Fraudulent Math, where we will compete to see who can come up with the most
outlandish, mind bending proofs of false statements and who can create
impossible constructions.

#### Redstone Engineering [Additional Registration Required]

Tired of your calculator? Build digital circuits to compute the Fibonacci
sequence using Minecraft redstone, also touching upon the basics of computer
architecture! No prior computer knowledge is needed, though familiarity with
Minecraft controls is recommended. Hosted at UC Berkeley's very own Open
Computing Facility.

Because of limited space in the Open Computing Facility, we will be releasing
a sign-up form after late-phase registration for those interested in the
activity. The location will be sent to those registered for the activity.

### Parent Activities

Between 9:00 AM and 1:00 PM, we will have a parent lounge in Dwinelle 155.
Additionally, we will have the following activites for parents.

#### ⭐ An Iconic IMO Problem and How I Came to the U.S. (9 AM – 11 AM) _by [Zvezdelina Stankova](https://math.berkeley.edu/~stankova/) [Dwinelle 155]_

We're honored to welcome Professor Zvezdelina Stankova from UC Berkeley's
Department of Mathematics as our guest speaker. Professor Stankova is an
International Math Olympiad (IMO) medalist, former coach of the USA team,
founder of the Berkeley Math Circle, and co-founder of the Bay Area Math
Olympiad (BAMO). She is an expert in the theory of permutation patterns and
has inspired generations of young mathematicians through her teaching and
outreach.

#### ⭐ Bitcoin, Hacking, and Fermat's Last Theorem (4:30 PM – 6:00 PM) _by [Pico Gilman](https://picogilman.github.io/) [Dwinelle 145]_
