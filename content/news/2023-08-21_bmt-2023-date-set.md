We are excited to announce that this yearâ€™s Berkeley Math Tournament (BMT) will
be on November 4, 2023 in person at UC Berkeley!

BMT is our flagship tournament designed for teams of advanced middle school or
high school students in mind, but younger students are allowed to participate.
With BMT we aim to introduce students to math beyond what is taught in the
classroom, and motivate students to explore math and prepare for future
mathematical endeavors.

For those curious about the problem style, past contests can be found in our
[archive](https://bmt.berkeley.edu/archive/).

Registration will open soon! To stay informed, keep an eye out for newsletters
and follow us on social media!
