We’ll create a slideshow based on the pre-submitted questions which we will
present during the session, and we’ll also take additional questions afterwards.
Please note that the Zoom will be recorded and posted on our website afterwards.
You are welcome to be off camera/ask questions in the chat if you are not
comfortable with your video or audio being recorded.

If you know anyone who is interested in math competitions but might not be as
familiar, please spread the word about the Q&A!
