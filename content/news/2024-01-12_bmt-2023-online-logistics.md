Teams may spend as little or as much time as they would like on the test, as
long as the test is submitted by 8:59 PM US Pacific Time on Sunday, January
14, 2024. Submission will be done via the
[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) platform. Teams will receive an email
detailing how to access Gradescope shortly.

As this process might take some time, we encourage teams to reserve at least 30
minutes to submit their work to ensure that all work can be submitted before the
deadline.

## 1/20 Main Event Logistics

The main event will take place on January 20, 2024. A schedule is provided
below:

| Time (US Pacific Time) | Event                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 10:00 – 10:30 AM       | Opening Ceremony         |
| 10:30 AM – 12:45 PM    | General and Focus Rounds |
| 12:45 – 1:45 PM        | Lunch                    |
| 1:45 – 3:30 PM         | Guts Round               |
| 3:30 – 4:30 PM         | Activities / Tiebreakers |
| 4:30 – 5:00 PM         | Awards Ceremony          |

The entirety of the event, including the Opening and Awards ceremonies, as well
as the testing rounds, will take place over Zoom. A link to join the Zoom
meeting will be sent out closer to the event date; please watch out for another
email about that.

The General, Focus, and Guts Rounds will be taken on the
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com/) platform. Students will use the platform
to view problems, submit answers, as well as collaborate with their teams on the
Guts Round.

All students should ensure that they can login to ContestDojo prior to the
event. If students were registered by a coach, they have received an email
containing their sign-in details. If students are having trouble logging in or
locating the BMT 2023 Online event, please try the Forgot Password function, or
email [questions@bmt.berkeley.edu](mailto:questions@bmt.berkeley.edu) for
assistance.

On Tuesday, January 16, a sample test will be opened on ContestDojo for students
to familiarize themselves with the platform. A brief guide on how to use the
site will also be shown during the opening ceremony, though we highly encourage
students to try the sample test beforehand to ensure a smooth process.

## Tiebreakers

The tiebreakers will be held for the top scoring students in the individual
round. Tiebreaker qualifiers will be announced at the end of lunch, and will
take a 15-minute test during the activities session. The test will consist of
three questions, and be scored primarily on correctness and secondarily on
submission time; that is, an earlier submission will be worth more than a later
one with the same number of correct answers, but less than a later one with more
correct answers.

## Activities

### Student Activities

After the Guts Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Integration Bee [Zoom]** – Compete against the best integrators around!
  Students will face off in an exciting integration race, solving difficult
  integrals involving some clever tricks, to determine who will be the champion
  of all integrators. -->

## Awards

Top-scoring individuals and teams will be announced at the Awards Ceremony from
4:30 – 5:00 PM. For BMT Online, we will provide an official ranking as well as
certificates for top-scoring teams. However, there will not be physical awards
for the online tournament.
