## Happy April Fools Day!
_Did we fool you?_ We won't actually be releasing any BmMT 2025 solutions just yet, but we're excited to launch our YouTube channel today! 

You can now watch two walkthrough videos where some of our Problem Writers talk about how to solve problems they wrote for the BmMT 2024 Relay Round!

The videos are available [here on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHMVNO8zfzDg3pTJ8l-urFA/community?pvf=CAE%253D). Watch our Head Problem Writer, Wen, explain Relay Set 7 (Questions 19 and 20), and check out Individual Test Organizer Theo going over Relay Question 17.

We hope this content helps you prepare for BmMT 2025, coming up on April 12th! As a reminder, registration closes this Friday, April 4th. Donâ€™t miss out!
