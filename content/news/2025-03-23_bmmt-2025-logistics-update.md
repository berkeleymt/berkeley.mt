Thank you for registering for BmMT 2025 on Saturday, April 12, 2025! This year’s BmMT will be the largest tournament we’ve run to date, with 1,200 expected students, and we’re excited to have you. Please read this email **in its entirety** to ensure your team is ready for the event.

## Rosters, Waivers, Refunds of Unused Seats

If you have more than one seat purchased, you have received an email from us with this announcement's text.

Each seat signifies a spot for one student at BmMT. Note that having purchased seats alone does not constitute a completed registration; you must also invite students and assign students to teams on ContestDojo. **Only students that have been assigned a team will be able to participate.** Additionally, all students must complete a waiver and photo release form through ContestDojo.

If you are unfamiliar with ContestDojo, please read our [ContestDojo Guide].

{% alert(title="For teams of 1 and 2", status="info") %}
We noticed many organizations have only purchased 1 or 2 seats. We believe the team-based aspects are crucial to the BmMT experience, and **strongly** recommend teams of at least 3. Additionally, teams smaller than 3 students will be disadvantaged by our scoring model.

You have until Friday, April 4 to purchase additional late registration seats, and you may also merge with other organizations who are already registered for the event. We have organized a [Teammate Finder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aoqwgLwDTWCMGTfLeQulcXZOD1WFGCsXztG1TJAKPVc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) spreadsheet for this use. Instructions are located on the spreadsheet.

## Schedule and Check-in

BmMT 2025 will begin at 8:00am and end before 6:30pm.

As in past years, coaches must check in their teams, where they will receive room assignments, tournament guides, pre-ordered T-shirts, and other materials. Coaches will also have the option to **check-in online** during the week before the tournament to expedite the morning process. Coaches that choose to check-in online must still come to the check-in area to pick up their materials.

More details about check-in and the online check-in option will be released soon, along with a detailed schedule of events for the day. **Please stay alert for this email, as understanding the check-in process is crucial to ensuring your students will be able to begin their tests on time.** Because of the scale of this year’s event, check-in will also be split between multiple rooms, so please take extra care.

## Food

We are offering lunch for $12 per sandwich, which can be purchased as add-ons on ContestDojo. The deadline for purchasing food is **Wednesday, April 2**. There are three menu options to choose from: Turkey, Pastrami, and Vegan. More details are available on the [Event Page].

Students, coaches and parents are also free to find their own food. Many restaurants can be found on the south side of campus (~10 minute walk from rooms) and in Downtown Berkeley (~15 minute walk from rooms).

## Hotels

As a reminder, for teams who are interested in booking a hotel room, we have a 
[Hotel Room Block](https://tinyurl.com/Bay-Area-Math-Tournament-Grp) with discounted rates around contest weekend at the Hotel Shattuck Plaza. The cost is $239 per night before taxes and fees.

Teams wishing to join the hotel block must book by **Tuesday, March 25**.
