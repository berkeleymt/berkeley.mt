Thank you everyone for coming to BMT 2024!

This was our largest BMT yet, with over 1000 students from over 100 schools
across the country. We hope everyone had as much fun as we did putting this
together. There's nothing like seeing so many excited students come together to
discover and celebrate math together.

If you believe you've lost something at the tournament, please email us at 
team@berkeley.mt with more information about the item (e.g. contents, brand, etc.) 
and a mailing address to return the item to, or some other method of reuniting 
you with your item, and we will do our best to find and return it to you. 

We'd also like to extend a special thanks to all the volunteers who helped make
this event possible, our amazing sponsors and supporters, the coaches and
parents who sacrificed their Sunday to bring their students to the tournament,
and, of course, the students themselves for their hard work and enthusiasm.

We hope to see you next year at BMT 2025! And for all the 8th graders and below 
who attended, we hope to see you at the Berkeley mini Math Tournament, our middle 
school contest, this upcoming spring. 

We'll be sending out score reports and the full results soon!
