To all Coaches and Parents,

Due to our [automatic tiebreaker policy](https://berkeley.mt/events/bmmt-2024/#tiebreakers), there is no need to run the Tiebreaker round. All students are free to go directly to activities following the Relay round. We hope to see you at our awards ceremony at 5:30 PM!
