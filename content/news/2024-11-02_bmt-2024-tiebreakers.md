We are requesting the following students to participate in a tiebreaker round.

Reminder that we have a new [Automatic Tiebreaking Policy](https://berkeley.mt/events/bmt-2024/#tiebreakers), which has resolved most ties! If you were not called for the tiebreaker round, this does _not_ mean you did not place in the top five.

**The following students should report immediately to their Guts Head Proctor after the end of the Guts Round, and will be taken to the tiebreaking room.**

### Algebra

- 013E — Benjamin Fu (Seattle Infinity Math Circle, Washington Gold)
- 027A — Alex Zhan (Think Academy, Think Team A)

### Geometry
