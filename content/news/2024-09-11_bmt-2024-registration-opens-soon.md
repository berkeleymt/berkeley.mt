How are you doing, fellow math enthusiasts?

BMT is coming back on Saturday, November 2nd, and we're excited to see you
there! Registration will open on **Monday, September 16 at 9:00 AM PT**. This
year, registration will take place in two phases to give smaller organizations
an opportunity to register.

Due to room constraints, we will limit the number of registrations. The exact
limit is yet to be finalized, but it will be greater than 750 students. While we
don't expect to reach this limit in Phase 1, we encourage coaches to register as
soon as possible to guarantee space.
