To all coaches and students,

contains the tournament day logistics.

{% button_link(href="/events/bmt-2024") %} Event Details {% end %}

## Important Information

During BMT, we will be posting updates to the website (<https://berkeley.mt>),
including tiebreaker qualifiers. Please be on the lookout for any announcements.
For any day-of directions, questions or concerns ask a BMT staff member or
volunteer wearing a charcoal gray shirt.

An annotated campus map is provided at the bottom of this page.

## Arrival and Check-in

{% alert(title="Online check-in available", status="info") %}
Starting October 28, coaches can optionally begin the check-in process online on
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com) to save time on tournament day. We
recommend all organizations that are ready to check in to do so online before
Saturday.

If you check-in online, you must still show up at your assigned check-in
location to pick up materials.
{% end %}

Check-in will happen in two different locations this year, depending on the
first letter of your organization’s name.

- **Orgs A-P, #** — Dwinelle 145 and 155, from 7:40 to 8:30 AM
- **Orgs Q-Z** — 3rd floor MLK Student Union, from 8:05 to 8:30 AM

At check-in, coaches will receive:

- An envelope for submitting the power round for each team in their
  organization. **Teams will not be able to compete in the power round without
  this envelope.** It is the coaches responsibility to pass the envelopes to the
  students.

- A sticker sheet containing name tags for each student with their ID, as well
  as their room assignments. **Students are responsible for remembering their
  student ID throughout the day. If a student writes an incorrect ID on their
  test, they may not receive a score.**

- An information packet about the tournament, containing a schedule, map, and
  other relevant information.

- A voucher for pre-ordered t-shirts. This voucher can be redeemed at a table
  near the check-in area.

- Vouchers for pre-ordered lunches, which can be redeemed during the lunch break
  in front of Dwinelle Hall.

**Check in closes promptly at 8:30 AM**, so please be on time. If you arrive
after this time, your team will be late to the power round, which puts them at a
great disadvantage.

### Parking

Parking can be found near campus at the following locations:

- Telegraph-Channing Garage _(recommended)_
- Underhill Garage
- RSF Garage
- Lower Sproul Garage
- Ellsworth Garage

More parking options are listed at the [Berkeley Parking and Transportation website].

## Testing Rooms

Each team will be assigned a room for their Power Round, Guts Round, and Awards
Ceremony during check-in. Room assignments will be provided on the sticker sheet
as well as emailed to all coaches, along with Team and Student IDs.

For Focus and General tests, students may go to any of the rooms assigned to
the test combination they selected. **Room assignments for each test combination
are listed on the tournament guide.**

Students are responsible for finding the rooms that their tests are taking place
in. A map is attached in the information packet provided at check-in.

## Lunch

There will be a 1 hour lunch period in the middle of the day for students to
get food. Pre-purchased lunches will be available for pick up in Dwinelle Plaza.
Many other options are available on the southern side of Berkeley campus.

## Activities

### Parent Activities

Between 9:00 AM and 1:00 PM, we will have a parent lounge in Dwinelle 155.
Additionally, we will have the following activites for parents.

- **Po Shen-Loh Talk (9 AM – 11 AM) [Dwinelle 155]** — Former USA IMO team
  coach Po-Shen Loh will be giving a talk in the parent lounge. Come join to
  hear his insights into math education!

- **Campus Tours (11 AM, 1 PM) [Dwinelle 155]** — We will be holding campus
  tours of UC Berkeley during the day, around 11 AM and 12 PM. Signups will
  happen during the day, and will be announced in the parent lounge.

- **Guts Viewing Room (2:30 – 5 PM) [Tilden]** — Come watch the Guts Round be
  scored live! Tilden is located on the 5th floor of the Martin Luther King, Jr.
  Student Union building (same building as Pauley Ballroom).

### Student Activities

After the Guts Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Estimathon [Pauley Ballroom]** — A team-based contest that combines
  trivia, game theory, strategy, and mathematical thinking. Teams of ~6 will be
  under a time limit to work on a set of 13 Fermi-style problems.

- **Fraudulent Math [Dwinelle 79, 88]** — Attention all students,
  mathematics is under attack by people who claim that we need “rigor” and
  “logic” to justify our answers. Join us for an event of Fraudulent Math, where
  we will compete to see who can come up with the most outlandish, mind bending
  proofs of false statements and who can create impossible constructions.

- **Integration Bee [Dwinelle 182, 183]** — Hosted by our Diamond Sponsor
  [<b><span class="text-black">blackpen</span><span class="text-red-500">redpen</span></b>](https://www.youtube.com/c/blackpenredpen)!
  Compete head to head against the best integrators around! Students will face
  off in a tournament style bracket, solving difficult integrals involving some
  clever tricks, to determine who will be the champion of all integrators.

- **Origami [Dwinelle 205, 206]** — Want to bring home a cute souvenir from BMT?
  Come join us for a fun origami session! We will be offering multiple paper
  patterns and instructions, and teaching from the basics of origami. No prior
  craft experience is needed.

- **Plank Countdown (new!) [Wheeler 222]** — Miss the excitement of the
  MATHCOUNTS® Countdown Round? Want to show off both your core strength and
  mental math simultaneously in a countdown match... while planking? If you'd
  enjoy that exciting and silly experience, come join us for our Plank Countdown
  tournament!

## Awards

The Awards Ceremony will take place simultaneously in Dwinelle 145, Dwinelle 155,
Genetics and Plant Biology 100, and Pauley Ballroom. Teams attending Awards
Ceremony **must attend in the auditorium they are assigned**, or else they may
not receive their award on time.

Awards room assignments are provided at check-in.
