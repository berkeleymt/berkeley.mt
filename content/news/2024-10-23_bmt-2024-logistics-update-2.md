Dear coaches,

Thank you for registering for BMT 2024 on Saturday, November 2, 2024! This year’s BMT will be the largest tournament we’ve run to date, with 1,200 expected students, and we’re excited to have you.

We are 10 days out from BMT! This email contains some more updates from the team.

We will be sending out a detailed day-of logistics email sometime in the next week!

## Food

The deadline for purchasing food has passed, so it is **no longer possible** to buy food offered by BMT (catered from Crave’s subs).

Students, coaches and parents are free to find their own food around Berkeley. Many restaurants can be found on the south side of campus (~10 minute walk from tournament rooms) and in Downtown Berkeley (~15 minute walk from tournament rooms).

## Coach volunteers

Due to the increased scale of BMT this year, we are requesting some coaches to assist with proctoring. If you are interested in helping out, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/v5DSz6UveghdAnvG7) and we will send you an email closer to the tournament date.

Please do not fill this form out if you are a student! Only adult coaches will be allowed to proctor. (Even if you are a student acting as a coach on behalf of an organization.)

## Reminder: Rosters, Waivers, Refunds of Unused Seats

If you have more than one seat purchased, you have received an email from us with this announcement's text.

Each seat signifies a spot for one student at BMT. Note that having purchased seats alone does not constitute a completed registration; you must also invite students and assign students to teams on ContestDojo. **Only students that have been assigned a team will be able to participate.** Additionally, all students must complete a waiver and photo release form (through ContestDojo).

If you are unfamiliar with ContestDojo, please read our [ContestDojo Guide].

**If your organization has seats that you don’t plan to use, please let us know as soon as possible so we can release these seats to teams on the waitlist.** If you let us know before October 26, you will receive a full refund. You can contact us at <team@berkeley.mt>.

{% alert(title="For teams of 1 and 2", status="info") %}
We noticed many organizations with only 1 or 2 seats purchased. We believe the team-based aspects are crucial to the BMT experience, and **strongly** recommend teams of at least 4. Additionally, teams smaller than 4 students will be disadvantaged by our scoring model.

Although it is too late to purchase additional seats, you may merge with other organizations who are already registered for the event. We have organized a [Teammate Finder] spreadsheet for this use. Instructions are located on the spreadsheet.

## Schedule and Check-in

We are excited to finally release the tournament schedule! The locations for each event will be released shortly, so please keep an eye out for that.

Check in **CLOSES** at 8:30 AM. If you arrive after this time, your team will be late to the power round, which puts them at a great disadvantage.
