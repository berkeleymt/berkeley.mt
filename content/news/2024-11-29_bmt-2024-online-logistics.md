## Registration and Check-in

Registration for BMT 2024 Online closed after November 28, 2024 at 11:59 US
Pacific Time. There is no check-in required for this event; however, no more
roster changes can be made after November 30 8:00 AM US Pacific Time.

Coaches, please ensure that all students are assigned to teams (you have dragged
them **out** of the "Unassigned Students" section on ContestDojo). If there are
any outstanding concerns with your team's roster, **please email
<team@berkeley.mt>** so we can resolve them before the start of the Power Round.

## 11/30–12/1 Power Round Logistics

The asynchronous Power Round will take place over the span of 36 hours. The
problems will be released on November 30, 2024 at 9:00 AM US Pacific Time, and
submissions will be due on December 1, 2024 at 8:59 PM US Pacific Time. The
Power Round will be a proof-based team round, and will be graded by our staff.

Teams may spend as little or as much time as they would like on the test, as
long as the test is submitted by 8:59 PM US Pacific Time on Sunday, December
1, 2024. Submission will be done via the [Gradescope] platform. Students and
coaches will receive an email detailing how to access Gradescope shortly.

As this process might take some time, we encourage teams to reserve at least 30
minutes to submit their work to ensure that all work can be submitted before the
deadline.

**Only one team member should upload their Gradescope submission.** Please
ensure that the email on your Gradescope account matches the email address
on ContestDojo. Please also clearly indicate the team name and ID on your
submission PDF.

## 12/7 Main Event Logistics

The main event will take place on December 7, 2024. A schedule is provided
below:

| Time (US Pacific Time) | Event                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 10:00 – 10:30 AM       | Opening Ceremony         |
| 10:30 AM – 12:45 PM    | General and Focus Rounds |
| 12:45 – 1:45 PM        | Lunch                    |
| 1:45 – 3:30 PM         | Guts Round               |
| 3:30 – 4:30 PM         | Activities / Tiebreakers |
| 4:30 – 5:00 PM         | Awards Ceremony          |

The entirety of the event, including the Opening and Awards ceremonies, as well
as the testing rounds, will take place on [Discord]. Discord is a communication
platform that allows for real-time chat, voice, and video calls. Students should
sign up for an account on the platform. Instructions on how to join the BMT
Discord channels will be sent to students after the Power Round.

The General, Focus, and Guts Rounds will be taken on the [ContestDojo] platform.
Students will use the platform to view problems, submit answers, as well as
collaborate with their teams on the Guts Round.

All students should ensure that they can login to ContestDojo prior to the
event. If students were registered by a coach, they have received an email
containing their sign-in details. If students are having trouble logging in or
locating the BMT 2024 Online event, please try the Forgot Password function, or
email <team@berkeley.mt> for assistance.

On Monday, December 2, a sample test will be opened on ContestDojo for students
to familiarize themselves with the platform. A brief guide on how to use the
site will also be shown during the opening ceremony, though we highly encourage
students to try the sample test beforehand to ensure a smooth process.

## Tiebreakers

We have a new Automatic Tiebreaking Policy, which has resolved most ties! If you
were not called for the tiebreaker round, this does _not_ mean you did not
place in the top five.

If necessary, additional tiebreaker rounds will be held as needed for top
scorers in the Individual Round. Tiebreaker qualifiers will be announced at the
end of lunch, and will take a 15-minute test during the activities session. The
test will consist of three questions, and be scored primarily on correctness and
secondarily on submission time; that is, an earlier submission will be worth more
than a later one with the same number of correct answers, but less than a later
one with more correct answers.

### Activities

After the Guts Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Estimathon** — A contest combining trivia, strategic planning, and sharp
  mathematical thinking. Teams of ~6 will race against the clock to tackle a
  challenging set of 13 Fermi-style problems, testing their ability to think fast
  and outsmart the competition.

- **Fraudulent Math** — Attention all students! Mathematics is under attack by
  people who claim that we need _rigor_ and _logic_ to justify our answers.
  Compete to see who can come up with the most outlandish, mind-bending falsehoods
  and impossible constructions.

- **Puzzle Platter** — Dive into a delectable feast of mind-bending puzzles from
  BmMT's greatest hits! Challenge yourself with our curated collection of the most
  engaging and creative puzzle rounds from past tournaments.

## Awards

Top-scoring individuals and teams will be announced at the Awards Ceremony from
4:30 – 5:00 PM. For BMT Online, we will provide an official ranking as well as
certificates for top-scoring teams. However, there will not be physical awards
for the online tournament.
