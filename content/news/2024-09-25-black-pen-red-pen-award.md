title = "BMT 2024 x blackpenredpen Student Mentor Appreciation Scholarship Application Now Open!"
+++

In collaboration with blackpenredpen, the team at BMT wants to support and celebrate the people we couldnâ€™t run the tournament without: the adults!

We know that the support and encouragement of parents, coaches, and teachers is vital for  students to pursue their education in bold ways such as math competitions. We appreciate the time spent transporting students to Berkeley, the hours you spend waiting for your students to finish testing, and the enthusiasm you bring to your teams.

The BMT 2024 blackpenredpen Student Mentor Appreciation Scholarship will award three teachers/coaches with a $500 grant. One student per BMT team can fill out the short application, describing how they have been encouraged and impacted by their mentor. The application deadline is October 26, and winners will be announced during the awards ceremony at BMT.
