We are excited to announce that this year’s Berkeley mini Math Tournament (BmMT)
will be on April 14, 2024, and the Berkeley Math Tournament (BMT) will be on
November 2, 2024, both in person at UC Berkeley!

BmMT is our annual “mini” in-person tournament for middle school and advanced
elementary school students! Through exciting formats like the Puzzle Round and
Relay Round, it showcases the beauty and fun of mathematics.

Registration is expected to open in late January. Stay tuned for more details!

_Note: A previous version of this announcement incorrectly mentioned the date of
BmMT 2024 as April 6, 2024. The post has since been updated to reflect the
correct date: April 14._
