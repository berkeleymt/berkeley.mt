To all coaches and students,

We are a week away from BmMT! Please read this email **in its entirety** as it
contains the tournament day logistics. Also attached is the Tournament Guide,
a concise two-page document containing the schedule of events and activities.
Coaches will receive physical copies of the Tournament Guide at check-in.

## Important Information

During BMT, we will be posting updates to the website (<https://berkeley.mt>),
including Tiebreaker qualifiers. Please be on the lookout for any announcements.
For any day-of directions, questions or concerns ask a BMT staff member or
volunteer wearing a dark purple shirt.

An annotated campus map is provided at the bottom of this page.

## Arrival and Check-in

{% alert(title="Online check-in available", status="info") %}
Starting April 5, coaches can optionally begin the check-in process online on
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com) to save time on tournament day. We
recommend all organizations that are ready to check in to do so online before
Saturday.

If you check-in online, you must still show up in the morning to pick up materials.
{% end %}

Check-in / materials pick-up will happen in Dwinelle Hall at **8:00 AM**:

- **Dwinelle 155** — Check-in
- **Dwinelle 145** — Materials pick-up for teams that checked in online

At check-in, coaches will receive:

- An envelope for submitting the Puzzle Round for each team in their
  organization. **Teams will not be able to compete in the Puzzle Round without
  this envelope.** It is the coaches responsibility to pass the envelopes to the
  students.

- A sticker sheet containing name tags for each student with their ID, as well
  as their room assignments. **Students are responsible for remembering their
  student ID throughout the day. If a student writes an incorrect ID on their
  test, they may not receive a score.**

- An information packet about the tournament, containing a schedule, map, and
  other relevant information.

- A voucher for pre-ordered t-shirts. This voucher can be redeemed at a table
  near the check-in area.

- A vouchers for pre-ordered lunches, which can be redeemed during the lunch
  break in front of Wheeler Hall.

**Check in closes promptly at 8:45 AM**, so please be on time. If you arrive
after this time, your team will be late to the Puzzle Round, which puts them at
a great disadvantage.

### Parking

Parking can be found near campus at the following locations:

- Telegraph Channing Garage _(recommended)_
- Underhill Garage
- RSF Garage
- Lower Sproul Garage
- Ellsworth Garage

More parking options are listed at the [UC Berkeley Parking and Transportation website] and the [City of Berkeley Parking website].

## Room Assignments

Each team will be assigned a Testing Room and an Awards Room during check-in.
Room assignments will be provided on the sticker sheet as well as emailed to all
coaches, along with Team and Student IDs.

Students are responsible for finding the rooms that their tests are taking place
in. A map is attached in the information packet provided at check-in.

## Lunch

There will be a 1 hour lunch period in the middle of the day for students to
get food. Pre-purchased lunches will be available for pick up in front of
Dwinelle Hall. Many other options are available on the southern side of Berkeley
campus.

## Activities

### Parent Activities

Between 9:00 AM and 5:30 PM, we will have a parent lounge in Pauley Ballroom.
Additionally, we will have the following activites for parents.

- **Po-Shen Loh Talk (9–11 AM) [Pauley Ballroom]** — A talk by Dr. Po-Shen Loh,
  mathematician and professor at Carnegie Mellon University, founder of LIVE, a
  revolutionary way to learn math online, and former coach of the US International
  Mathematical Olympiad team. Come join to hear his insights into math education!

- **Campus Tour (11 AM) [Pauley Ballroom]** — Join us on a tour of the beautiful
  UC Berkeley campus! Signups will be announced in the parent lounge, after Dr.
  Po-Shen Loh's talk.

- **Tangled Topology: The Magic of Klein Bottles! [Dwinelle 155]** — Join us
  for an engaging presentation by Cliff Stoll—astronomer, author, and creator
  of handcrafted glass Klein bottles through his company Acme Klein Bottle. Hear
  about the fascinating world of topology, exploring concepts such as Möbius
  loops and the Klein bottle, a surface with no distinguishable "inside" or
  "outside."

### Student Activities

After the Relay Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Tangled Topology: The Magic of Klein Bottles! [Dwinelle 155]** — Join us
  for an engaging presentation by Cliff Stoll—astronomer, author, and creator
  of handcrafted glass Klein bottles through his company Acme Klein Bottle. Hear
  about the fascinating world of topology, exploring concepts such as Möbius
  loops and the Klein bottle, a surface with no distinguishable "inside" or
  "outside."

  A few lucky students will even go home with a free Klein bottle!

- **Countdown [Dwinelle 179, 182, 183, 187]** — Face off against 63 other
  challengers in the ultimate mental math showdown! In this fast-paced,
  single-elimination bracket, you'll need to bring both speed and smarts... win
  and move on, lose and you're out! Seconds matter, and only the quickest will
  survive. Just one will come out on top... will it be you?

- **Estimathon [Hearst Field Annex A1]** — A contest combining trivia,
  strategic planning, and sharp mathematical thinking. Teams of \~6 will race
  against the clock to tackle a challenging set of 13 Fermi-style problems,
  testing their ability to think fast and outsmart the competition.

- **Proofs Without Words [Dwinelle 223, 229]** — Get ready to see math like
  never before! Take concepts you might already know and explore them in fun,
  visual, and totally different ways. We'll give you new ways to think and cool
  ideas to show off the next time you find yourself in a boring classroom.

- **Origami [Wheeler 200, 202, 204]** — Want to take home a cute souvenir from
  BmMT, or build a beautiful spiky ball with us? We've got a variety of paper
  patterns and instructions, and we'll teach from the basics of modular origami.
  No prior craft experience is needed!

- **Float, Fly, Fascinate! [Dwinelle 215, 219]** — Every wondered how boats
  stay afloat and how airplanes soar through the sky? Join the Society of
  Physics Students at Berkeley for exciting hands-on demonstrations that reveal
  the physics behind the everyday wonders you take for granted.

## Awards Ceremony

The Awards Ceremony will take place simultaneously in Dwinelle 155 and Pauley
Ballroom. Organizations will be assigned a room at check-in. Teams attending
Awards Ceremony **must attend in the auditorium they are assigned**, or else
they may not receive their award on time.
