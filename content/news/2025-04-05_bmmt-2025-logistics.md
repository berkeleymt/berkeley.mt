To all coaches and students,

We are a week away from BmMT! Please read this email **in its entirety** as it
contains the tournament day logistics. Also attached is the Tournament Guide,
a concise two-page document containing the schedule of events and activities.
Coaches will receive physical copies of the Tournament Guide at check-in.

## Important Information

During BmMT, we will be posting updates to the website (<https://berkeley.mt>),
including Tiebreaker qualifiers. Please be on the lookout for any announcements.
For any day-of directions, questions or concerns ask a BMT staff member or
volunteer wearing a dark purple shirt.

An annotated campus map is provided at the bottom of this page.

### Information Booth

For students lost or arriving late, we will hold an information booth in
the lobby of Dwinelle Hall after the Puzzle Round begins at 9:00 AM.

## Arrival and Check-in

{% alert(title="Online check-in available", status="info") %}
Starting April 5, coaches can optionally begin the check-in process online on
[ContestDojo](https://contestdojo.com) to save time on tournament day. We
recommend all organizations that are ready to check in to do so online before
Saturday.

If you check in online, you must still show up in the morning to pick up materials.
{% end %}

Check-in / materials pick-up will happen in Dwinelle Hall at **8:00 AM**:

- **Check-in** _(if haven't checked in online)_ — Dwinelle 155
- **Materials Pick-up** _(if checked in online)_ — Dwinelle 145

At check-in, coaches will receive:

- An envelope for submitting the Puzzle Round for each team in their
  organization. **Teams will not be able to compete in the Puzzle Round without
  this envelope.** It is the coaches responsibility to pass the envelopes to the
  students.

- A sticker sheet containing name tags for each student with their ID, as well
  as their room assignments. **Students are responsible for remembering their
  student ID throughout the day. If a student writes an incorrect ID on their
  test, they may not receive a score.**

- An information packet about the tournament, containing a schedule, map, and
  other relevant information.

- A voucher for pre-ordered t-shirts. This voucher can be redeemed at a table
  near the check-in area.

- A voucher for pre-ordered lunches, which can be redeemed during the lunch
  break in front of Dwinelle Hall.

**Check-in closes promptly at 8:45 AM**, so please be on time. If you arrive
after this time, your team will be late to the Puzzle Round, which puts them at
a great disadvantage.

### Parking

Parking can be found near campus at the following locations:

- Telegraph Channing Garage _(recommended)_
- Underhill Garage
- RSF Garage
- Lower Sproul Garage
- Ellsworth Garage

More parking options are listed at the [UC Berkeley Parking and Transportation website] and the [City of Berkeley Parking website].

\* _Tiebreaker qualifiers will be posted on the website, sent to coaches via email, and announced after Relay._

## Room Assignments

Each team will be assigned a Testing Room and an Awards Room during check-in.
Room assignments will be provided on the sticker sheet as well as emailed to all
coaches, along with Team and Student IDs.

Students are responsible for finding the rooms that their tests are taking place
in. A map is attached in the information packet provided at check-in.

## Lunch

There will be a 1 hour lunch period in the middle of the day for students to
get food. Pre-purchased lunches will be available for pick up in front of
Dwinelle Hall. Many other options are available on the southern side of Berkeley
campus.

  "inside" or "outside."

### Student Activities

After the Relay Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Tangled Topology: A Journey Through Mathematical Surfaces!

  A few lucky students will even go home with a free Klein bottle!

- **Estimathon [Hearst Field Annex A1]** — A contest combining trivia,
  strategic planning, and sharp mathematical thinking. Teams of \~3 will race
