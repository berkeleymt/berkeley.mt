## Important Information

For any questions or concerns before or during the event, ask a BMT staff member
by emailing <team@berkeley.mt>.

## Registration and Check-in

Registration for BMT 2025 Online will close on November 27, 2025 at 11:59 PM US
Pacific Time. There is no check-in required for this event; however, no more
roster changes can be made after November 29 at 8:00 AM US Pacific Time.

Coaches, please ensure that all students are assigned to teams (you have dragged
them **out** of the "Unassigned Students" section on ContestDojo). If there are
any outstanding concerns with your team's roster, **please email
<team@berkeley.mt>** so we can resolve them before the start of the Power Round.

## 11/29–11/30 Power Round Logistics

The asynchronous Power Round will take place over the span of 41 hours. The
problems will be released on November 29, 2025 at 7:00 AM US Pacific Time, and
submissions will be due on November 30, 2025 at 11:59 PM US Pacific Time. The
Power Round will be a proof-based team round and will be graded by our staff.

| Time (US Pacific Time) | Event                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| November 29, 7:00 AM   | Power Round Released  |
| November 30, 11:59 PM  | Power Submissions Due |

The test will be released at this Google Drive link at 7:00 AM US Pacific Time
on Saturday, November 29, 2025:

<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FUnNBNL8E64M-3U8DEvxUVQh3tCdGLQh?usp=sharing>

Teams may spend as little or as much time as they would like on the test, as
long as the test is submitted by 8:59 PM US Pacific Time on Sunday, November
30, 2025. Submission will be done via the [Gradescope] platform. Students and
coaches will receive an email detailing how to access Gradescope shortly.

{% alert(title="Submission Template Required", status="info") %}
Teams must use the submission template provided in the Google Drive folder to
submit their Power Round, either printed out or annotated electronically. The
template is located in the same folder as the test.

If students do not have access to a printer, they must clearly outline the
same information that is in the template, in roughly the same locations on the
page.
{% end %}

As this process might take some time, we encourage teams to reserve at least 30
minutes to submit their work to ensure that all work can be submitted before the
deadline.

**Only one team member should upload their Gradescope submission.** Please
ensure that the email on your Gradescope account matches the email address
on ContestDojo. Please also clearly indicate the team name and ID on your
submission PDF.

Access to a crafts store might be helpful for the Power Round. While not
required, having basic craft supplies on hand could enhance your team's
problem-solving experience.

## 12/6 Main Event Logistics

The main event will take place on December 6, 2025. A schedule is provided
below:

| Time (US Pacific Time) | Event                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 8:00 – 8:30 AM         | Opening Ceremony           |
| 8:30 – 10:45 AM        | General / Focus            |
| 10:45 – 11:45 AM       | Break                      |
| 11:45 AM – 1:30 PM     | Guts                       |
| 1:30 – 2:30 PM         | Activities and Tiebreakers |
| 2:30 – 3:30 PM         | Awards Ceremony            |

The entirety of the event, including the Opening and Awards ceremonies, as well
as the testing rounds, will take place on [Zoom], video conferencing software.
Students should download the Zoom software to their computer prior to the event.
The Zoom meeting link will be sent to students the day before the event.

{% alert(title="Camera Requirement for Awards Eligibility", status="info") %}
Students must have their cameras on during all testing rounds to be eligible for
awards. This is to ensure academic integrity throughout the competition.
{% end %}

The General, Focus, and Guts Rounds will be taken on the [ContestDojo] platform.
Students will use the platform to view problems, submit answers, as well as
collaborate with their teams on the Guts Round.

All students should ensure that they can login to ContestDojo prior to the
event. If students were registered by a coach, they have received an email
containing their sign-in details. If students are having trouble logging in or
locating the BMT 2025 Online event, please try the Forgot Password function, or
email <team@berkeley.mt> for assistance.

A sample test will be opened on ContestDojo for students to familiarize
themselves with the platform. A brief guide on how to use the site will also be
shown during the opening ceremony, though we highly encourage students to try
the sample test beforehand to ensure a smooth process.

### Communication

You are responsible for setting up your own communication with your team — the
BMT team will not be coordinating communication, and the main Zoom room will not
be able to be used to communicate with your teammates.

## Tiebreakers

We have a new Automatic Tiebreaking Policy, which we expect to resolve most ties! If you
were not called for the tiebreaker round, this does _not_ mean you did not
place in the top five.

If necessary, additional tiebreaker rounds will be held as needed for top
scorers in the Individual Round. Tiebreaker qualifiers will be announced at the
end of lunch and will take a 15-minute test during the activities session. The
test will consist of either three (for the Focus Tests) or five (for the General
Test) questions and be scored primarily on correctness and secondarily on
submission time; that is, an earlier submission will be worth more than a later
one with the same number of correct answers, but less than a later one with more
correct answers.

Students may submit multiple times within the duration of the test, but only the
last submission will be considered.

## Activities

After the Guts Round, we will be hosting student activities. These are optional
activities that promote recreational math, and include the following:

- **Estimathon** — A contest combining trivia, strategic planning, and sharp
  mathematical thinking. Teams of 3 will race against the clock to tackle a
  challenging set of 13 Fermi-style problems, testing their ability to think fast
  and outsmart the competition.

- **Integration Bee** — Compete head to head against the best integrators around!
  Students will face off in a tournament style bracket, solving difficult
  integrals involving some clever tricks, to determine who will be the champion
  of all integrators.

- **Countdown** — Miss the excitement of the MATHCOUNTS® Countdown Round? Come
  show off your mental math skills in a countdown match to see who can solve
  problems the fastest!

## Waivers

If your waiver is not yet signed, please have it signed before the opening
ceremony. You will not be allowed to participate in any of the events without
having your waiver signed, and no extra time will be given if you are unable to
start due to not having a signed waiver.

## Awards

Top-scoring individuals and teams will be announced at the Awards Ceremony from
2:30 – 3:30 PM. For BMT Online, we will provide an official ranking as well as
certificates for top-scoring teams. However, there will not be physical awards
for the online tournament.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should coaches/parents do during the event?

Coaches/parents should help their students log into Zoom and their ContestDojo
student accounts; no further action is required from coaches on the day of the
event. As long as all of your students are successfully registered (placed on a
team and their waivers are signed), then you are all set! Coaches are welcome to
join the Opening and Award Ceremonies. Due to Zoom capacity restrictions, we ask
that parents watch the Opening and Award Ceremonies with their children on the
same device.

### Will students be penalized for not attending the Opening Ceremony?

We will go over the schedule and how to navigate ContestDojo during the opening
ceremony, so we strongly encourage students to attend. While there is no score
penalty for missing the opening ceremony, students who encounter difficulties
navigating ContestDojo will not receive extra time. Please be sure to attend the
opening ceremony to familiarize yourself with the platform.

### Can students be in the same room while taking the individual test?

Yes. During the Individual round, students may be in the same room, but they
must work independently. Each student should submit answers on their own device
and refrain from communicating. We will be monitoring submissions for suspicious
patterns and activity.

### Can students work together on the Guts round in person if they are on the same team?

Yes! We encourage students on the same team to collaborate in person or online
during the Guts round.

### How do students submit the Guts round answers?

Students can choose to share a device or use their own devices to submit Guts
round answers. ContestDojo will automatically sync everyone's work so that when
one teammate updates an answer, it automatically updates for the other team
members, and only the most recently inputted answer is submitted.

Note that it may be helpful for team members to have their own device open (even
just to view the questions), so everyone can follow along and discuss in real
time.

### Are calculators or other reference material allowed?

Graph paper and calculators are prohibited, but protractors, rulers, scratch
paper, and compasses are permitted. You may print out the questions if you would
like. Use of AI or any other outside resource during the testing round is
strictly prohibited. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated, and failure to
comply with all rules may result in immediate and irreversible disqualification.
Students who have viewed the exam or its solutions should come forward and not
take the tests.
