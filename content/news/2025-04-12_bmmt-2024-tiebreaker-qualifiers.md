We are requesting the following students to participate in a tiebreaker round.

Reminder that we have a new [Automatic Tiebreaking Policy](https://berkeley.mt/events/bmmt-2025/#tiebreakers), which has resolved most ties! If you were not called for the tiebreaker round, this does _not_ mean you did not place in the top five.

**The following students should report immediately Wheeler 130, and will be taken to the tiebreaking room.**

- 080D — Jeffrey Ding
- 107E — Lusen Yao
- 115B — Landon Wan
- 119A — Aryan Shome
- 202C — Daniel Li
- 204B — William Wu
