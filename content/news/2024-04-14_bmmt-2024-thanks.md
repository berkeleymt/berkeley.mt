Thank you everyone for coming to BmMT 2024!

This was our largest BmMT yet, with over 750 students from over 100 schools
across the country. We hope everyone had as much fun as we did putting this
together. There's nothing like seeing so many excited students come together to
discover and celebrate math together.

We'd also like to extend a special thanks to all the volunteers who helped make
this event possible, our amazing sponsors and supporters, the coaches and
parents who sacrificed their Sunday to bring their students to the tournament,
and, of course, the students themselves for their hard work and enthusiasm.

For all the 8th graders who attended, we hope to see you at the Berkeley Math
Tournament, our flagship high school contest, this fall. Especially eager
non-8th graders are welcome to join us as well!

We'll be sending out score reports and the full results soon!
